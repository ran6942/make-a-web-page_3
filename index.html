          <ul>
            <li><span>World Wide Web</span>: A collection of html documents</li>
            <li><span>Internet</span>: World's largest computer network</li>
            <li><span>Browser</span>: A program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web</li>
            <li><span>Http</span>: Main protocol of the web</li>
            <li><span>Server</span>: A computer that's optimized for hosting files that make up the web</li>
            <li><span>HTML</span>: <i>Hyper Text Markup Language</i>. HTML is the main document of the web. It's the basis for everything on the web.</li>
            <li><span>Tag</span>: Contained with angled brackets. Non-void tags have an opening &amp; closing tag</li>
            <li><span>Elements</span>: Refers to everything set within opening &amp; closing tag</li>
            <li><span>Attribute</span>: Property of html element</li>

      <h2>How the Web Works</h2>
        <div>
          <p>The main components of the web are:</p>
            <div>
              <ol>
                <li>1) The User + Computer &amp; Browser</li>
                <li>2) The Internet</li>
                <li>3) Servers</li>
                <li>4) Files</li> 
              </ol>  
            </div>
          <p>The browser that the user is running on his computer makes requests using the http protocol via the internet to the server. When the server receives the request, it responds by returning files to the browser. The browser then interprets and displays the files.
          </p>
        </div>

    <div>
      <h2>HTML <i>(Hyper Text Markup Language)</i></h2>
        <div>
          <p>HTML is the main document of the web. HTML is the main structure of web pages.</p>
          <p>HTML is made up of:</p>
            <div>
              <ol>
                <li>Text content - what you see</li>
                <li>Markup - what it looks like</li>
                <li>References to other document</li>
                <li>Links to other pages</li>  
              </ol>
            </div>  
          <p>HTML markup is made of elements, which are made of tags. 
          <p>Elements can be block or inline elements. Block element content is contained within an invisible box, whereas inline element content is contained within their tags and does not start a new line.</p>

        </div>

      <h2>Main Takeaways</h2>
        <div>
          <ol>
            <li>A webpage is a text document written in html. Web browsers interpret and render these documents. These documents are stored on a server.</li>
            <li>Coding is writing text in a language that the computer can understand. The computer reads these instructions and executes the instructions.</li>
            <li>Computers are stupid. Programmers must write exactly the way a computer understands. The syntax of the language must be precise and accurate. Computers don't have the capability to understand context</li>
            <li>Programmers can't remember everything, so don't stress out about memorizing everything.</li>
          </ol>

    <h1>Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>Vocabulary</h2>
        <div>
          <ul>
            <li><span>CSS (Cascading Stylesheets)</span>: CSS is a language used to control the styling components of a web page.</li>
            <li><span>DOM (Document Object Model)</span>: The DOM is a cross-platform, language agnostic convention for representing and interacting with objects in html.</li>
            <li><span>Javascript</span>: Javascript controls the interactive components of a webpage.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>  
    </div>
    <div>    
      <h2>Document Object Model (DOM)</h2>
        <div>
          <p>The browser builds a tree-like, branching structure of a web page, otherwise known as the DOM tree. The browser turns html tags into elements that form nodes of the tree. The DOM is an alternative representation of an HTML document.</p>
          <p>Mozilla Developer Network provides a comprehensive introduction to the DOM <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction">HERE</a>.</p>

    <div>    
      <h2>Boxes, Boxes, Boxes</h2>
        <div>
          <p>Everything on a web page is a box. You can break down web page elements into boxes nested within boxes, nested within boxes.</p>
          <p>Using a browser's developer tools, one can access any web page source and observe this. Understanding this concept of elements being contained in a box can be very helpful when laying out contents of a web page.</p>
          <p><a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-css-box-model/">CSS-Tricks</a> has a easy to understand article about the box model.</p>
